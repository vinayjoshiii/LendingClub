#Lending Club

/*The work revolves around a consumer finance company specializing in various loan offerings for urban customers.
When assessing loan applications, the company faces two primary risks: 
 1. Approving loans to individuals who may default, resulting in financial loss
 2. Rejecting loans to potential customers who could contribute positively to the company's business

This dual risk underscores the importance of informed decision-making based on applicant profiles and historical data.

The task is to utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to discern patterns and trends within the loan dataset, thereby identifying indicators of default risk. By doing so, we empower the lending institution to make more informed decisions, minimize losses, and optimize its lending portfolio.*/
